# microcosm-perf
A performance oriented implementation of the microcosm algorithm (with brute forcing) to aid in solving the microcosm puzzle.<br><br>See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-y6Bi5mSY to learn about the puzzle, and head over to [r/solvingmicrocosm](https://www.reddit.com/r/solvingmicrocosm/)  to join the discussion.

### Planned features
- Interactive console application UI.
- Nemesizer shift option.
- Flexible input similar to https://github.com/derfarctor/brute whereby a number of potential lines can be specified for each page, a number of potential keys, or none at all in which case all are used in brute forcing.
- Multithreading.
- Logging.
