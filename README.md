# microcosm-perf
A performance oriented implementation of the microcosm algorithm (with brute forcing) to aid in solving the microcosm puzzle.<br><br>See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-y6Bi5mSY to learn about the puzzle, and head over to [r/solvingmicrocosm](https://www.reddit.com/r/solvingmicrocosm/)  to join the discussion.

**To run the program, you will need a copy of a word list (one word per line) named words.txt inside the same directory as the program.**

### Features
- Interactive console application UI
- Nemesizer shift option
- Flexible input whereby a number of potential lines can be specified for each page, a number of potential keys, or none at all in which case all are used in brute forcing
- Multithreading
- Logging

### Planned
- Random brute forcing mode
